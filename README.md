# 🚧 PIS-24-07: Construction of an artifact for the detection of antipatterns

> **Status:** 🟡 *Project in progress — formal DSR phase not yet initiated*  
> **Keywords:** Antipattern · Artifact · Detection · Software Engineering · Lifecycle

## 📖 Introduction
Antipatterns in software engineering represent recurrent yet ineffective solutions to common problems, causing issues throughout the software development lifecycle.  
This project **PIS-24-07** continues the work of [**PIS-23-28**](https://github.com/software-adn-lab/PIS-23-28-PUBLIC), aiming to **design an artifact for detecting antipatterns** across all phases: analysis, design, implementation, and testing.  

Currently, the project is in its **early stage**:  
- Assistants are performing **validation and verification** of already constructed artifacts.  
- The main activity is the **writing of scientific articles** based on these validations and preliminary findings.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an artifact to detect antipatterns across the software development lifecycle.  
- Ensure higher software quality, maintainability, and security.  
- Provide reproducible results to the academic and industrial communities.
